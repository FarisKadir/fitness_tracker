## Description

I created this application to allow a user to track their workouts. A user can create a new workout, then add exercises that they completed to the workout. It can also display the statistics of the workouts.

## User_Story
```
As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
```
